##This project is a front-end user interface for an E-Learning Platform, designed to simulate the core features of a modern online education system. The main goal is to provide users—especially students—with an engaging, intuitive, and responsive experience while navigating through courses, tracking their learning progress, and watching embedded video lessons. The interface includes multiple styled pages such as a Home Page, Course Listing Page, Course Details Page, Video Player Page, and a Progress Dashboard.

The Course Listing Page displays a variety of available courses, each with a title, description, category, and thumbnail. On selecting a course, users are taken to the Course Details Page, where they can read more about the course content, structure, and modules. Each module includes a video lesson embedded directly within the interface for a seamless learning experience. The embedded video player allows learners to consume content without leaving the platform, ensuring focused and uninterrupted study sessions.
An important feature of this platform is progress tracking. Users can visually monitor their course completion through indicators like progress bars or percentage counters. Although this front-end project does not include actual user authentication or database integration, the UI components are built in a way that simulates dynamic behavior for demo and testing purposes.

The platform is fully responsive, designed to function smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The layout adapts based on screen size, ensuring accessibility and ease of use across different platforms. The project leverages modern front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Optionally, it may be enhanced with frameworks like React or Vue.js and styling libraries such as Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.

This project is ideal for showcasing front-end development skills, UI/UX design, and layout structuring. It serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced features like login/signup functionality, quizzes, user dashboards, certificate generation, or integration with real-time databases and APIs. Whether you're learning front-end technologies or prototyping a full-fledged educational platform, this project demonstrates a strong understanding of core UI principles and responsive design tailored for digital learning environments.
